Link Predictor
==============

This is a program that reads in a tab-delimited list of movies with their actors (usage can be altered to be something different from movies and actors). A graph is created that connects actors (nodes) based on their shared movies (edges). The program can predict possible connections based on either preexisting connections or node proximity. The program utilized Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse the graph in the shortest possible path between two nodes in the graph. The program can also find the minimal k-core of the graph.
